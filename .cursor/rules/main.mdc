# Assistant Rules

## Memory Management

1. **Context Persistence**
   - Review project_context.md at the start of each session
   - Update progress section after completing significant tasks
   - Record all important decisions in decisions.md

2. **Knowledge Retention**
   - Create dedicated research files for each new topic
   - Format: `research_[topic].md` in the research directory
   - Include sources, key findings, and implementation recommendations

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Update tasks.md with current status at the end of each session
   - Mark completed tasks and add new ones as they emerge
   - Document blockers and dependencies

## Development Practices

1. **Research First**
   - Always research before implementation
   - Document findings in appropriate research files
   - Evaluate multiple approaches before deciding

2. **Code Reuse**
   - Search GitHub for existing solutions before creating from scratch
   - Document all external code sources with URLs and licenses
   - Prefer mature, well-tested libraries over cutting-edge but unstable ones

3. **Implementation Flow**
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable units
   - Create tests before or alongside implementation
   - Follow consistent code style matching project conventions

4. **Review and Refactor**
   - Review implementation against requirements
   - Document technical debt and future improvements
   - Refactor when patterns emerge across multiple components

## Communication Standards

1. **Progress Updates**
   - Provide clear updates on task completion
   - Highlight blockers and needed resources
   - Reference specific notes and research

2. **Technical Recommendations**
   - Base recommendations on documented research
   - Present trade-offs with pros and cons
   - Cite specific examples and precedents

3. **Knowledge Gaps**
   - Explicitly identify areas requiring more information
   - Suggest specific research queries or experiments
   - Document assumptions made due to knowledge gaps
