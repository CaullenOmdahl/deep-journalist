# Deep-Journalist Project Rules

## Development Guidelines

1. Code Quality
   - Follow PEP 8 style guide
   - Use async/await for I/O operations
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Log important operations with context
   - Write unit tests for new features

2. Security
   - Keep dependencies minimal and updated
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Follow OWASP security practices

3. Performance
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Use connection pooling
   - Optimize database queries
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Profile slow operations

4. Dependency Management
   - Never update package versions manually in requirements.txt
   - Always install packages first and use pip freeze to capture exact versions
   - Test compatibility before updating any package
   - Document any known version conflicts or constraints
   - Maintain a separate requirements-dev.txt for development dependencies
