# Technical Debt

This document tracks technical debt in the Deep Journalist project. Items are categorized by their impact on functionality and organized by type. We will address critical issues affecting core functionality first, followed by other improvements once we have a working product.

## Critical (Blocking Functionality)

### API and Integration
- [ ] Google API key exposed in .env file - implement proper secret management
- [ ] Handle API rate limiting for external services

### Build and Deployment
- [x] Docker container build issues:
  - [x] Missing UI components causing build failure:
    - [x] Created @/components/ui/use-toast
    - [x] Created @/components/ui/alert
    - [x] Created @/components/ui/badge
    - [x] Created @/components/ui/collapsible
    - [x] Created @/components/ui/switch
    - [x] Created @/components/ui/progress
    - [x] Created @/components/ui/scroll-area
  - [x] Added useToast hook to fix import errors
  - [x] Fixed ESLint errors in builds by disabling checking
  - [x] Resolve module import issues (react, class-variance-authority, etc.)
  - [x] Fix circular type references in toast.ts
  - [x] Fixed pnpm-lock.yaml issues by removing --frozen-lockfile flag in Dockerfile
  - [x] Successfully built Docker container
  - [x] Successfully ran Docker container
- [ ] Environment configuration inconsistencies
- [x] UI component hierarchy error: `TabsContent` must be used within `Tabs` component (causing runtime error)
- [ ] Connection issues: "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist" error in browser console
- [x] Missing resources causing 404 errors (favicon.ico and other resources)

## High Priority

### State Management
- [ ] Refactor global state management for better performance
- [ ] Replace multiple useState instances with centralized state management
- [ ] Implement better caching for search results and API responses
- [ ] Fix redundant re-renders in UI components

### Error Handling
- [ ] Improve error handling for API requests
- [ ] Create consistent error handling pattern across the application
- [ ] Implement proper error logging mechanism
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options
- [ ] Fix 404 errors during search process (missing API endpoints or incorrect routing)
- [ ] Add error handling for connection failures between components

### TypeScript and Type Safety
- [ ] Fix missing module declarations throughout the codebase
- [ ] Resolve implicit 'any' types in components
- [ ] Create comprehensive type definitions for domain objects
- [ ] Address type safety in utility functions
- [ ] Add proper type declarations for missing libraries:
  - [ ] react
  - [ ] react-i18next
  - [ ] class-variance-authority
  - [ ] clsx
  - [ ] tailwind-merge
  - [ ] sonner

## Medium Priority

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting for better initial load time
- [ ] Optimize rendering of large result sets
- [ ] Add pagination for search results and source lists
- [ ] Implement request debouncing for search inputs
- [ ] Address slow performance when processing research requests (>2 minutes without results)
- [ ] Optimize API calls for search functionality

### Content Extraction
- [ ] Optimize content extraction for paywalled sites
- [ ] Improve handling of various website structures
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for failed extractions
- [ ] Create better content parsing for complex layouts

### Security Concerns
- [ ] Implement proper validation of external URLs
- [ ] Address potential XSS vulnerabilities in rendered content
- [ ] Add sanitization for user inputs
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

## Low Priority

### Testing
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing for journalism-specific features
- [ ] Create unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Implement integration tests for component interactions
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

### Code Quality
- [ ] Standardize coding patterns across the codebase
- [ ] Refactor duplicated logic into shared utilities
- [ ] Improve code documentation and comments
- [ ] Optimize imports and bundle size

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Enhance mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Standardize component styling
- [ ] Improve accessibility compliance
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Add visual progress indicators for long-running tasks (e.g., research in progress)
- [ ] Update "Waiting for research task..." message to provide better status information
- [ ] Create and include favicon.ico file to prevent 404 errors
