## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Get [Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. One-click deployment of the project, you can choose to deploy to Vercel or Cloudflare

   [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fu14app%2Fdeep-research&project-name=deep-journalist&repository-name=deep-journalist)

   Currently the project supports deployment to Cloudflare, but you need to follow [How to deploy to Cloudflare Pages](./docs/How-to-deploy-to-Cloudflare-Pages.md) to do it.

3. Start using

## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

Follow these steps to get Deep Journalist up and running on your local browser.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.18.0 or later recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/u14app/deep-journalist.git
   cd deep-journalist
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install  # or npm install or yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and configure the following environment variables:

   ```env
   # (Optional) Server-side Gemini API Key (Required for server API calls)
   GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=

   # (Optional) Server API Proxy URL. Default, `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
   API_PROXY_BASE_URL=

   # (Optional) Server API Access Password for enhanced security
   ACCESS_PASSWORD=

   # (Optional) Injected script code can be used for statistics or error tracking.
   HEAD_SCRIPTS=
   ```

   **Important Notes on Environment Variables:**

   - `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`: **Optional but required for using the server-side API.** You need to obtain a Google Generative AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). This key should be kept secret and **never committed to your public repository.**
   - `API_PROXY_BASE_URL`: **Optional.** If you need to use a proxy server for API requests, configure this variable with your proxy server's base URL. This is relevant for server-side API calls.
   - `ACCESS_PASSWORD`: **Optional but highly recommended for server-side deployments.** Set a strong password to protect your server-side API endpoints. This password will be required to access server-side API functionalities.
   - `HEAD_SCRIPTS`: **Optional** Injected script code can be used for statistics or error tracking.

   **Privacy Reminder:** These environment variables are primarily used for **server-side API calls**. When using the **local API mode**, no API keys or server-side configurations are needed, further enhancing your privacy.
   **Multi-key Support:** Supports multiple keys, each key is separated by `,`, i.e. `key1,key2,key3`

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev  # or npm run dev or yarn dev
   ```

   Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access Deep Journalist.

## üö¢ Deployment

### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fu14app%2Fdeep-research&project-name=deep-journalist&repository-name=deep-journalist)

### Cloudflare

Currently the project supports deployment to Cloudflare, but you need to follow [How to deploy to Cloudflare Pages](./docs/How-to-deploy-to-Cloudflare-Pages.md) to do it.

### Docker

> The Docker version needs to be 20 or above, otherwise it will prompt that the image cannot be found.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Most of the time, the docker version will lag behind the latest version by 1 to 2 days, so the "update exists" prompt will continue to appear after deployment, which is normal.

```bash
docker pull xiangfa/deep-journalist:latest
docker run -d --name deep-journalist -p 3333:3000 xiangfa/deep-journalist
```

You can also specify additional environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d --name deep-journalist \
   -p 3333:3000 \
   -e GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSy... \
   -e ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-password \
   xiangfa/deep-journalist
```

or build your own docker image:

```bash
docker build -t deep-journalist .
docker run -d --name deep-journalist -p 3333:3000 deep-journalist
```

If you need to specify other environment variables, please add `-e key=value` to the above command to specify it.

Deploy using `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
version: '3.9'
services:
   deep-journalist:
      image: xiangfa/deep-journalist
      container_name: deep-journalist
      environment:
         - GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
         - ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-password
      ports:
         - 3333:3000
```

or build your own docker compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

### Static Deployment

You can also build a static page version directly, and then upload all files in the `out` directory to any website service that supports static pages, such as Github Page, Cloudflare, Vercel, etc..

```bash
pnpm build:export
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

As mentioned in the "Getting Started" section, Deep Journalist utilizes the following environment variables for server-side API configurations:

- `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
- `API_PROXY_BASE_URL`
- `ACCESS_PASSWORD`

These variables are **only required if you intend to use the server-side API calling functionality.** For local API calls, no configuration is necessary beyond setting up the project.

## üîå API Reference

Deep Journalist provides several API endpoints for various functionalities:

### Server Settings
- **GET `/api/settings`**: Returns server environment variables needed by the client (API key, proxy URL, access password).

### Google AI Model Endpoints
- **GET `/api/models`**: Retrieves a list of available Google Gemini AI models using server-side API key.
- **GET `/api/mock/models`**: Provides mock model data for development and testing purposes.
- **GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/ai/google/[...slug]`**: Proxy endpoint for Google Generative AI API calls with added security and CORS headers. Routes requests to Google's API with appropriate authentication.

### URL Content Extraction
- **POST `/api/extract-url`**: Extracts content from a provided URL, avoiding CORS issues by handling the request server-side. Returns structured data including title, author, content, and metadata.

### Testing
- **GET `/api/test`**: Tests the configured API keys, returning validation results for each key.

All API endpoints include proper CORS headers and error handling. Server-side endpoints are protected by the configured `ACCESS_PASSWORD` when set.

## üß† Journalistic Principles

Deep Journalist adheres to the Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics:

1. **Seek Truth and Report It:** The application verifies facts from multiple sources, distinguishes between statements and verified information, and provides proper context.

2. **Minimize Harm:** Articles are designed to show respect for privacy and dignity, avoiding sensationalism and showing compassion for those affected by news coverage.

3. **Act Independently:** The system generates content free from outside influence and discloses potential conflicts of interest in sources.

4. **Be Accountable and Transparent:** Each article includes a methodology section explaining how information was gathered and verified, acknowledging limitations and gaps.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy

Deep Journalist is designed with your privacy in mind. **All research data and generated articles are stored locally on your machine.** We do not collect or transmit any of your research data to external servers (unless you are explicitly using server-side API calls, in which case data is sent to Google's Gemini API through your configured proxy if any). Your privacy is our priority.
