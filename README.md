## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Get [Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Clone this repository
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CaullenOmdahl/deep-journalist.git
   cd deep-journalist
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

Follow these steps to get Deep Journalist up and running on your local browser.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.18.0 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CaullenOmdahl/deep-journalist.git
   cd deep-journalist
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install  # or pnpm install or yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and configure the following environment variables:

   ```env
   # (Optional) Server-side Gemini API Key (Required for server API calls)
   GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

   # (Optional) Server API Proxy URL. Default, `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
   API_PROXY_BASE_URL=

   # (Optional) Server API Access Password for enhanced security
   ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here

   # (Optional) Injected script code can be used for statistics or error tracking.
   HEAD_SCRIPTS=
   ```

   **Important Notes on Environment Variables:**

   - `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`: **Optional but required for using the server-side API.** You need to obtain a Google Generative AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). This key should be kept secret and **never committed to your public repository.**
   - `API_PROXY_BASE_URL`: **Optional.** If you need to use a proxy server for API requests, configure this variable with your proxy server's base URL. This is relevant for server-side API calls.
   - `ACCESS_PASSWORD`: **Optional but highly recommended for server-side deployments.** Set a strong password to protect your server-side API endpoints. This password will be required to access server-side API functionalities.
   - `HEAD_SCRIPTS`: **Optional** Injected script code can be used for statistics or error tracking.

   **Privacy Reminder:** These environment variables are primarily used for **server-side API calls**. When using the **local API mode**, no API keys or server-side configurations are needed, further enhancing your privacy.
   **Multi-key Support:** Supports multiple keys, each key is separated by `,`, i.e. `key1,key2,key3`

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev  # or pnpm dev or yarn dev
   ```

   Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access Deep Journalist.

## üö¢ Deployment

### Static Deployment

You can build a static page version directly, and then upload all files in the `out` directory to any website service that supports static pages.

```bash
npm run build:export
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

As mentioned in the "Getting Started" section, Deep Journalist utilizes the following environment variables for server-side API configurations:

- `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
- `API_PROXY_BASE_URL`
- `ACCESS_PASSWORD`

These variables are **only required if you intend to use the server-side API calling functionality.** For local API calls, no configuration is necessary beyond setting up the project.

## üîå API Reference

Deep Journalist provides several API endpoints for various functionalities:

### Server Settings
- **GET `/api/settings`**: Returns server environment variables needed by the client (API key, proxy URL, access password).

### Google AI Model Endpoints
- **GET `/api/models`**: Retrieves a list of available Google Gemini AI models using server-side API key.
- **GET `/api/mock/models`**: Provides mock model data for development and testing purposes.
- **GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/ai/google/[...slug]`**: Proxy endpoint for Google Generative AI API calls with added security and CORS headers. Routes requests to Google's API with appropriate authentication.

### URL Content Extraction
- **POST `/api/extract-url`**: Extracts content from a provided URL, avoiding CORS issues by handling the request server-side. Returns structured data including title, author, content, and metadata.

### Testing
- **GET `/api/test`**: Tests the configured API keys, returning validation results for each key.

All API endpoints include proper CORS headers and error handling. Server-side endpoints are protected by the configured `ACCESS_PASSWORD` when set.

## üß† Journalistic Principles

Deep Journalist adheres to the Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics:

1. **Seek Truth and Report It:** The application verifies facts from multiple sources, distinguishes between statements and verified information, and provides proper context.

2. **Minimize Harm:** Articles are designed to show respect for privacy and dignity, avoiding sensationalism and showing compassion for those affected by news coverage.

3. **Act Independently:** The system generates content free from outside influence and discloses potential conflicts of interest in sources.

4. **Be Accountable and Transparent:** Each article includes a methodology section explaining how information was gathered and verified, acknowledging limitations and gaps.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy

Deep Journalist is designed with your privacy in mind. **All research data and generated articles are stored locally on your machine.** We do not collect or transmit any of your research data to external servers (unless you are explicitly using server-side API calls, in which case data is sent to Google's Gemini API through your configured proxy if any). Your privacy is our priority.
